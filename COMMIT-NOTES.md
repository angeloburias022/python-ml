# Commit Notes for Trading Predictor Implementation

## Commit Message



## Explanation
In this commit, we have introduced a new trading predictor that leverages key technical indicators and machine learning algorithms:

### Key Features:
- **Average Directional Index (ADX):**
  - Helps identify the strength of a trend.
  - Crucial for making informed trading decisions.

- **RandomForestClassifier Algorithm:**
  - Used for predicting price movements.
  - Analyzes historical stock data based on various features such as:
    - Moving averages
    - Relative Strength Index (RSI)

### Benefits:
- Enhances the model's capability to analyze and predict market behavior effectively.
- Combines technical indicators and machine learning for better accuracy in trading predictions.

## Notes:
- The ADX indicator assists in determining whether the market is trending or ranging.
- The RandomForestClassifier is robust and suitable for classification tasks, providing flexibility in modeling complex relationships.
